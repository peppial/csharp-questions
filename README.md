###### 1. What's the output?

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Test(null));
    }

    static string Test(object o) => "object";
    static string Test(dynamic d) => "dynamic";
}
```

- A: dynamic
- B: object
- C: Type 'Program' already defines a member called 'Test' with the same parameter types
- D: Cannot convert null literal to non-nullable reference type

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C
In C#, method overloading is based on compile-time types. While dynamic behaves differently at runtime, at compile-time, dynamic is just an <b>alias</b> for object.
Since method overloading does not allow two methods with identical signatures (same method name and parameter types), the  <b>compiler does not allow this code to compile</b>.

###### 2. What's the output?

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int[] numbers = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
        ModifyArray(numbers);
        
        Console.WriteLine(numbers == null ? "Array is null" : $"Array is not null, Length: {numbers.Length}");
    }

    static void ModifyArray(int[] arr)
    {
        arr = null;
    }
}
```

- A: Array is not null, Length: 3
- B: Array is not null, Length: 0
- C: Array is null
- D: Not all code paths return a value

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
In C#, method parameters are passed by value by default. 
For reference types (like classes and arrays), the reference itself is passed by value - meaning <b>the method receives a copy of the reference</b>, not the original reference. However, both references point to the same object in memory, so changes to the object's properties within the method will be visible outside the method.

When you call ModifyArray(numbers); the value of the reference (a pointer to the array in memory) is copied into the method parameter arr.
So now, inside the method: <b>arr is a copy of the reference</b> to the original array numbers.
If you do arr = null;, you're only modifying the copy, not the original. The original numbers in Main() remains untouched.

###### 3. What's the output?

```csharp
class Program
{
    static object _lock = new object();

    static async Task Main()
    {
        DoWorkAsync();
    }
    
    static async Task DoWorkAsync()
    {
        lock (_lock)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Entered lock");
            await Task.Delay(1000); 
            Console.WriteLine("Leaving lock");
        }
    }
}
```

- A: Entered lock, Leaving lock
- B: A deadlock
- C: No output
- D: Cannot await in the body of a lock statement

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D
When you await inside a lock, you risk not releasing the lock immediately.
When the method resumes, it might do so on a <b>different thread</b> that didnâ€™t acquire the lock originally, violating the Monitorâ€™s rules.
This is why the compiler doesn't even let you do it. It throws an error to protect you from unsafe behaivour.

Instead, you should use <b>SemaphoreSlim</b>.

###### 4. What's the output?

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<Action> actions = new List<Action>();

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        {
            Action a = () => Console.WriteLine($"Lambda captured: {i}");
            actions.Add(a);
        }

        foreach (var action in actions)
        {
            action();
        }
    }
}
```

- A: Lambda captured: 0
     Lambda captured: 1
     Lambda captured: 2
- B: Lambda captured: 3
     Lambda captured: 3
     Lambda captured: 3
- C: Lambda captured: 2
     Lambda captured: 2
     Lambda captured: 2
- D: Compiler error

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
Each lambda is capturing the variable i, not its value. The variable i is declared outside the lambda, and the lambda holds a reference to it.
When the foreach runs the lambdas, the loop has already finished â€” and i == 3. So, the lambdas donâ€™t capture 0, 1, 2 â€” they all reference the same variable, and its final value is 3.

To fix it introduce a variable in the loop:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    int copy = i; // ðŸ‘ˆ new variable per iteration
    actions.Add(() => Console.WriteLine($"Lambda captured: {copy}"));
}
```

###### 5. What's the output?

```csharp

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        SomethingAsync();
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }

    static async void SomethingAsync()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        throw new Exception("Exception");
    }
}
```

- A: The application crashes
- B: Hello World!
- C: Compiler error
- D: Hello World! and the application crashes.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
When you call an async void method, it behaves like fire-and-forget. Control immediately returns to the caller â€” in this case, back to Main() â€” without waiting for the await to finish. Meanwhile, the await Task.Delay(1000) delays execution for 1 second. 
After that delay, the exception should be thrown â€” but by that time, Main has already printed the message and the application has exited.

###### 6. What's the output?

```csharp

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        try
        {
            var task = ThrowingMethodAsync();
            Console.WriteLine("Task started, waiting for it to complete...");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Caught: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }

    static async Task ThrowingMethodAsync()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Something went wrong");
    }
}
```

- A: Task started, waiting for it to complete...
     Something went wrong
- B: Something went wrong
- C: Task started, waiting for it to complete...
- D: The application crashes

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C
Because the async Task method runs in the background (it is not awaited) the Main method finishes immediately after the Console.WriteLine.
Since the exception is thrown after Main is already done, it has no place to be caught, and the try-catch block around the var task = ... line is useless.

###### 7. What's the output?

```csharp

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int[] numbers = [ 1, 2, 3 ];

        ModifyArray(numbers);
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", numbers));

        ResetArray(numbers);
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", numbers));
    }

    static void ModifyArray(int[] arr)
    {
        arr[0] = 99;
    }

    static void ResetArray(int[] arr)
    {
        arr = [0,0,0];
    }
}

```

- A: <br>1, 2, 3<br>
     1, 2, 3
- B: <br>1, 2, 3<br>
     0, 0, 0
- C: <br>99, 2, 3<br>
     0, 0, 0
- D: <br>99, 2, 3<br>
     99, 2, 3

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D
In ResetArray, arr is a copy of the reference to numbers.
When we assign arr = [ 0, 0, 0 ], we are changing the local variable arr to point to a new array. But this change <b>is not visible to the caller</b>. The original numbers array is unchanged. So numbers still points to the array with values: 99, 2, 3.

###### 8. What's the output?

```csharp

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string a = "hello";
        string b = "he" + "llo";
        string c = string.Concat("he", "llo");
        string d = new string("hello".ToCharArray());

        Console.WriteLine(object.ReferenceEquals(a, b));
        Console.WriteLine(object.ReferenceEquals(a, c));
        Console.WriteLine(object.ReferenceEquals(a, d));
    }
}

```

- A: True, False, False
- B: True, True, True
- C: False, False, False
- D: True, True, False


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
string a = "hello"; this is a string literal, so it's interned â€” stored in the intern pool. a points to that interned string.   
string b = "he" + "llo";
Both parts are string literals. Same interned string as a.   
string c = string.Concat("he", "llo");
This is evaluated at runtime. Even though the value is "hello", the result is not interned automatically.
So c refers to a new string instance with the same content.   
string d = new string("hello".ToCharArray());
This explicitly creates a new string object using a char[].
It will never refer to the interned version unless you manually intern it using string.Intern().

</p>

###### 9. What's the output?

```csharp

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string a = "hello";
        string b = a;
        string c = "hello";
        string d = new string("hello".ToCharArray());

        Console.WriteLine(object.ReferenceEquals(a, b));
        Console.WriteLine(object.ReferenceEquals(a, c));
        Console.WriteLine(a == d);
        Console.WriteLine(a.Equals(d));
    }
}

```

- A: True, False, True, True
- B: True, True, True, True
- C: True, True, True, False 
- D: False, False, True, True


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

True     -  a and b point to the same reference  
True     -  a and c are both interned "hello"  
True     -  a and d have same content (== is overridden)  
True     -  Equals() checks content equality

###### 10. What's the output?

```csharp

class Program
{   
    private static int a = b;
    private static int b = 10;

    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(a);
    }
}

```

- A: 10
- B: Use of unassigned local variable 'b'
- C: Runtime Error
- D: 0

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Static fields in C# are initialized in the order they are declared in the class, not in the order of their references in the code. 
a is declared first, and it is initialized with the value of b. 
However, b is declared after a, and its default value is 0 (because it's an int and the default value for int is 0).

###### 11. What's the output?

```csharp

class Counter
{
    public static int Count = 0;

    public static void Increment()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++)
        {
            Count++;
        }
    }
}

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        var task1 = Task.Run(() => Counter.Increment());
        var task2 = Task.Run(() => Counter.Increment());

        await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2);

        Console.WriteLine($"Final Count: {Counter.Count}");
    }
}


```

- A: Final Count: 1000000
- B: Final Count: 2000000
- C: More than 2000000
- D: Less than 2000000

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The Count++ operation is not thread-safe, as it involves a read-modify-write sequence that can be interrupted by other threads.  
Since both tasks run concurrently, increments may overlap, leading to lost updates and a final count less than 2000000. This happens because the static field is shared across threads, and no synchronization (like Interlocked or lock) is used.

###### 12. What's the output?

```csharp

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        try
        {
            ThrowingTask();
            Console.WriteLine("Main continues...");
            await Task.Delay(2000);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Caught: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }

    static async Task ThrowingTask()
    {
        await Task.Delay(500);
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Boom!");
    }
}


```

- A: Main continues.. Caught: Boom!
- B: Main continues..
- C: No output
- D: Main continues.. Application crashes

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The exception in ThrowingTask is thrown on a background thread, but since the task is <b>not awaited</b>, the exception is never observed by the Main methodâ€™s try-catch. Unobserved task exceptions can crash the application or be silently ignored, depending on the runtime and .NET version. This is why fire-and-forget tasks should be avoided unless properly handled, e.g., with logging or exception capturing.

###### 13. What's the output?

```csharp

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int[] numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
        Span<int> slice = numbers.AsSpan(1, 3);

        for (int i = 0; i < slice.Length; i++)
        {
            slice[i] *= 2;
        }

        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", numbers));
    }
}

```

- A: 2, 4, 6, 4, 5
- B: 1, 4, 6, 8, 5
- C: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- D: Compile-time error: cannot slice an array with Span

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
Span<T> provides a <b>view</b> over the original memory, not a copy. In this case, numbers.AsSpan(1, 3) creates a span covering elements at index 1 to 3 (values 2, 3, 4), and the loop doubles those values in-place. Because Span<T> directly references the original array memory, any changes to it reflect in the original array, making it both efficient and safe for high-performance scenarios without additional allocations.

###### 14. What's the output?

```csharp

class Base
{
    public virtual void Show() => Console.WriteLine("Base.Show");
}

class Derived : Base
{
    public void Show() => Console.WriteLine("Derived.Show");
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Base obj = new Derived();
        obj.Show();
    }
}

```

- A: Runtime error
- B: Derived.Show
- C: No Output
- D: Base.Show

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D
Base declares a virtual method Show().
Derived hides (not overrides!) the Show() method by declaring public void Show() without using the override keyword.
At runtime, you're calling obj.Show() where obj is of type Base â€” and since method hiding (via new) is resolved by the compile-time type, Base.Show() is called, not Derived.Show().

To get polymorphic behavior (Derived.Show()), the method in Derived must be marked with override. Otherwise, it hides the base method, and calls are resolved by the reference type â€” not the instance type.</p>

###### 15. What's the output?

}

```

- A: Derived.Static Base.Static Derived.Instance Derived.Instance
- B: Base.Static Base.Static Derived.Instance Derived.Instance
- C: Derived.Static Base.Static Base.Instance Derived.Instance
- D: Compiler error

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
Derived.WhoAmI() calls the static method defined in Derived, which hides the one in Base, so it prints "Derived.Static".  
Base.WhoAmI() calls the static method from Base, because <b>static methods are resolved at compile time based on the reference type</b>, not the runtime object type.  
Both d.Identify() and b.Identify() call the <b>overridden</b> Identify method from Derived, because instance virtual methods are resolved at runtime based on the actual object type (Derived), so both print "Derived.Instance".

- C: Static Base  
Field Initialization  
Static Derived  
Instance Base  
Instance Derived

- D: Field Initialization  
Static Base  
Static Derived  
Instance Base  
Instance Derived


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
Derived's static constructor runs first because it's the first type used in Main, even though it's a derived class â€” static constructors are triggered based on usage, not inheritance chain.
The instance field msg in Derived is initialized before the base constructor runs, so "Field Initialization" is printed next.
After that, Base's static constructor runs, followed by its instance constructor, and finally Derived's instance constructor. Base class instance constructors are <b>always called</b> before derived class constructors.

###### 17. What's the output?

```csharp

struct S { }

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        S s = new S();
        object o1 = s;
        object o2 = s;
        Console.WriteLine(object.ReferenceEquals(o1, o2));
    }
}

```

- A: True
- B: False
- C: Runtime exception
- D: Compiler error


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
S is a value type (a struct), and when you assign it to object, <b>boxing</b> occurs â€” meaning the value is copied into a new object on the heap.
When you do object o1 = s; and then object o2 = s;, each boxing operation creates a new boxed copy of the value. 
So o1 and o2 refer to different objects, even though they hold the same value â€” and therefore, object.ReferenceEquals(o1, o2) returns false.

###### 18. What's the output?

```csharp

public class A { }

public static class Extensions
{
    public static void Foo(this A a) => Console.WriteLine("Extension");
}

public class B : A
{
    public void Foo() => Console.WriteLine("Instance");
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        A obj = new B();
        obj.Foo();
    }
}

```

- A: Compiler error
- B: Extension
- C: Instance
- D: Runtime exception

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
B defines an instance method Foo(), but obj is declared as type A, and A does not have a method called Foo().
Since A has no Foo() instance method, the compiler uses the extension method defined in Extensions.
Even though obj is actually a B at runtime, method resolution for extension methods is static, based on the compile-time type (A), not the runtime type (B). So Extension is printed.

###### 19. What's the output?

```csharp

public interface IAnimal { }

public class Dog : IAnimal { }

public static class Extensions
{
    public static void Speak<T>(this T animal) where T : IAnimal
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
    }

    public static void Speak(this object obj)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Generic object");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        object dog = new Dog();
        dog.Speak();
    }
}

```

- A: Compiler error
- B: Woof
- C: Generic object
- D: Runtime exception

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C
The output is <b>Generic object</b> because the variable dog is declared as object, not as Dog or IAnimal. Extension methods are resolved at compile time based on the static type of the variable, and object does not meet the generic constraint where T : IAnimal. Therefore, the compiler picks the non-generic Speak(this object obj) extension method.

###### 20. What's the output?

```csharp

class Program
{
    static ref int Find(ref int x, ref int y)
    {
        if (x > y)
            return ref x;
        else
            return ref y;
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        int a = 5, b = 10;
        ref int max = ref Find(ref a, ref b);
        max = 100;
        Console.WriteLine($"{a}, {b}");
    }
}

```

- A: 100, 10
- B: 5, 100
- C: 5, 10
- D: 100, 100

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
The method Find returns a <b>reference</b> to either x or y, depending on which is greater. Since b (10) is greater than a (5), Find returns a reference to b, and max becomes a reference to b. Setting max = 100 changes the value of b, so the final output is 5, 100.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C
When Select is called, it assigns b = a, so z gets the original value of x, which is 1. 
Then Select returns a reference to x, and y is a ref to x, so changing y = 5 actually modifies x to 5.  
Thus, the final output is 5 1, because x became 5, but z (copied before modification) remains 1.

}

```
- A: 4 16
- B: 100 144
- C: Nothing (empty output)
- D: Throws an exception

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
LINQ uses <b>deferred execution</b>, meaning the query is not evaluated when defined, but only when enumerated inside foreach.  
However, numbers was reassigned to a new range (10â€“14), and the query still refers to the <b>old enumerable (1â€“5)</b> because Enumerable.Range(1,5) produces an immutable sequence.  
Thus, the original even numbers 2 and 4 are selected, squared to 4 and 16, and the output is 4 16.

}


```
- A: Throws an exception
- B: 210
- C: 012
- D: 222

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
The LINQ query uses deferred execution, so counter++ is not evaluated until the query is enumerated.  
When query.Reverse() is executed, it forces evaluation of Select, incrementing counter as it maps 0, 1, 2 (in order), and then reverses the result to 2, 1, 0.

```
- A: 333
- B: 123
- C: 111
- D: 321

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A or B (depending on C# version)
The lambda () => Console.Write(i) captures the loop variable i from the LINQ Select statement.  
In older C# versions (pre-C# 5), all the lambdas would share the same captured i, resulting in 333.  
In modern C#, LINQ with Select(i => ...) creates a new i per iteration (no closure issue here), so each Action correctly captures a distinct value.  
Therefore, when each Action in the array is invoked, it prints 1, 2, then 3.

```
- A: Second   
First,Second,Third
- B: Second  
Third,Second,First
- C: Second  
Second,First,Third
- D: First  
Third,Second,First

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
Task.WhenAny(t1, t2, t3) returns the first completed task (not necessarily in the order written). t2 has the shortest delay (500ms), so it finishes first.
Therefore, firstDone becomes t2. await firstDone unwraps the result of t2, which is "Second".  

Task.WhenAll(t1, t2, t3) waits for all tasks to finish and gathers their results in <b>the original order</b> they were defined (t1, t2, t3). 
So the second output is: "First,Second,Third".

2
- D: Looping

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
The numbers variable holds an IEnumerable<int> produced by Get(), which uses yield return, meaning it's lazily evaluated.  
The first call to numbers.Any() triggers enumeration, causing "Generating" to print once as it starts iterating to check if any elements exist.  
The second enumeration in the foreach loop restarts the iterator, so "Generating" is printed again before yielding the values 1 and 2.

- B: 21:20
- C: 12:20
- D: 12:30
  
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C
In C#, multicast delegates (created using +) invoke all combined methods, but only the result of the last delegate is returned.
f1 prints "1" and returns 10. f2 prints "2" and returns 20.

When calling f(), both f1 and f2 are invoked, in order (f1, then f2), so Console.Write("1") then Console.Write("2") happens â€” output: 12. 
f() returns the result of f2, which is 20, and that is printed after the colon.

}


```

- A: Generic
- B: Non-generic
- C: Compiler error
- D: Runtime error
  
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
When the method Print(b) is called with an object of type B, the compiler considers both the generic method Print<T>(T item) and the non-generic method Print(A item). 
The method Print<T>(T item) can be used because B is a subclass of A, and it matches the constraint where T : A. The compiler will infer T as B, making it a valid call for the generic method.  
In C#, the generic method is preferred over the non-generic one when the generic method's type constraint is satisfied. In this case, B satisfies T : A, so the generic method is chosen.

```

- A: Compilation error
- B: Runtime InvalidCastException
- C: Prints "Dog"
- D: Prints "Animal"
  
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
In C#, generic interfaces are <b>not covariant</b> by default unless explicitly declared with the out keyword on the type parameter.
IProducer<T> interface is declared as interface IProducer<T>, without covariance. Therefore, even though Dog derives from Animal, IProducer<Dog> cannot be assigned to IProducer<Animal>. 

So the line: ` IProducer<Animal> animalProducer = dogProducer;`
causes a compile-time error: "Cannot implicitly convert type `IProducer<Dog>` to `IProducer<Animal>`." 
To make this code compile the interface should be declared as: `interface IProducer<out T>`

```

- A: Compilation error
- B: Start 1 End
- C: Start 1
- D: Start End 1
  
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C
When Generate() is called in the foreach, the method body doesn't execute immediately. It starts execution only when the enumerator is advanced (e.g., by entering the loop).
The line Console.WriteLine("Start") is printed right before the first yield return 1.  
After yield return 1, control returns to the loop, which prints 1 and breaks. Because of the break, the iterator is not advanced further, so "End" is never printed.

- A: Runtime error

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D
Initially, both x and y reference the same Box object on the heap (Value = 100). 
When Modify(ref x) is called, it replaces the reference in x with a new Box instance (Value = 200). However, this change only affects x because itâ€™s passed by reference.  
y still points to the original Box instance (Value = 100), so Console.WriteLine(y.Value) prints 100.

- C: System.Func`2[System.Int32,System.String][]
- D: System.Func cannot be inferred from method group
  
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
The line `var funcs = new[] { (Func<int, object>)Format, Box };` causes both Format and Box to be treated as `Func<int, object>`. Although Format returns string, and string is implicitly convertible to object, this cast makes the method group compatible with Func<int, object> through covariance in the return type. The compiler infers the array type as Func<int, object>[]. This compiles because both method references can be converted to that delegate type, even though their actual return types differ.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
When the static method SayHello is first accessed, the runtime invokes the static constructor static A() before executing SayHello(). Then, creating a new instance with new A() triggers the instance constructor, printing "Instance A". Static constructors are called automatically once before any static members are accessed or an instance is created, whichever comes first.

#### Answer: C
In this code, p1 == p2 returns False because even though both records have the same data, they are of different runtime types (Person vs Employee), and record equality checks for both value and type equality. ReferenceEquals(p1, p2) also returns False since they are two separate instances in memory. Record equality in C# requires both the type and the values of all properties to match exactly.

#### Answer: C
The switch expression uses pattern matching to check the runtime type and properties of a Shape instance. Since s is a Circle with radius 5, it doesnâ€™t match the Radius > 10 case but matches the general Circle case, resulting in "Small Circle" being printed. This demonstrates property-based pattern matching and pattern ordering in C#.

#### Answer: C
The try block sets x to 20 and then throws an exception. The catch block catches the exception and sets x to 30. The finally block always runs, setting x to 40.
After the finally block finishes, execution resumes after the entire try-catch-finally structure, so the line x = 50; runs and sets x to 50.
Therefore, when ModifyValue finishes, x is 50, which is printed.

#### Answer: D
The pattern [double x, double y] matches because the input ReadOnlySpan<double> contains exactly two elements. List patterns in C# match the structure and length of the input sequence; here, the compiler checks that the span has a length of 2 and binds the first element to x and the second to y. Since the input is [5.0, 7.0], this pattern is a perfect match and gets selected in the switch.

The lock statement uses a <b>reentrant lock</b>, meaning the <b>same thread</b> can acquire the lock multiple times without deadlocking.

- D: Complication error

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
The in modifier prevents reassignment of the parameter c, but since Counter is a reference type, its internal state can still be modified. c.Increment() increases the Value to 6, and both c.Value and counter.Value reflect that change. Hence, the output is 66.

```

- A: 0
- B: 1
- C: Complication Error
- D: Runtime error

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
Foo<T> is a generic class, so each closed generic type (Foo<int>, Foo<double>, etc.) has its own separate static field. Incrementing Foo<int>.Count does not affect Foo<double>.Count, which remains at its default value of 0. Hence, the output is 0.

###### 47. What's the output?

```csharp

var numbers = GetNumbers();
var evenNumbers = numbers.Select(n => n * 2);
Console.WriteLine(evenNumbers.FirstOrDefault());

IEnumerable<int> GetNumbers()

}

```

- A: 0
- B: 2
- C: Exception is thrown
- D: Compilation error

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
The method GetNumbers() uses yield return, so it's lazily evaluated. FirstOrDefault() causes only the first value to be pulled from the iterator, which yields 1, and then 1 * 2 = 2 is returned. The throw new Exception() is never reached, so no exception is thrown.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
In C#, structs are value types. When bar.Foo.Change(5) is called, it operates on a <b>copy of the struct</b> returned by the getter, not the actual Foo inside Bar. Therefore, the original Foo inside bar remains unchanged, and val stays 0.

- A: Many 0
- B: 1 1 1 1
- C: Exception is thrown
- D: 1 2 3 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
List<T>.Enumerator is a value type (a struct), and in this code, list.Items is accessed repeatedly inside the loop. Since list.Items returns a copy of the enumerator every time (due to value semantics of structs), each call to MoveNext() operates on a fresh, unadvanced copy. Therefore, MoveNext() always returns true, and Current always returns the default int value, which is 0. This causes an infinite loop of 0s being printed.

#### Answer: B
a == b: True because == checks value equality for strings.
a == c: True, both are "XY", and interning ensures c points to the same string as a.
(object)a == (object)b: False because b was constructed at runtime and is not interned; it's a different reference.
(object)a == (object)c: True because string.Intern(b) returns the reference of the already interned string "XY" that a refers to.

###### 51. What's the output?

```csharp

object o = "hello";
A.Print(o);

class A

    public static void Print<T>(T value) => Console.WriteLine("Generic");
    public static void Print(string value) => Console.WriteLine("String");
}


```

- A: Exception is thrown
- B: Complication error
- C: Generic
- D: String

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C
The variable o is declared as object, so the call Print(o) resolves to Print<T>(T) with T inferred as object.
Method overloading in C# is resolved at compile-time, and the actual runtime type of the object is not considered when selecting an overload.
Even though the runtime type is string, the compiler chooses the generic overload because it matches the compile-time type.

- D: Non-deterministic

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
All three lambda expressions capture the same variable i by reference, not by value. By the time the parallel execution starts, the loop has completed and i has the value 3. So all three actions will print 3, resulting in output 333.

Only C is invalid due to the non-void return type.

A partial method isn't required to have an implementing declaration in the following cases:

It doesn't have any accessibility modifiers (including the default private).
It returns void.
It doesn't have any out parameters.
It doesn't have any of the following modifiers virtual, override, sealed, new, or extern.

```

- A: 0
- B: 42
- C: Compilation error
- D: Runtime exception

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
When `ArrayPool<T>.Return()` is called, it does **not clear** the array by default. So when the same array is rented again, it may still contain old data like `42`. To avoid this, you must return the array with `clearArray: true`.

- A: string
- B: object
- C: Compilation error
- D: Runtime exception

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D
The call to `GetMethod("Say", ...)` fails because there are two private overloads: one that takes `object` and one that takes `string`.  
Since `GetMethod` does not know which one to return, it throws an `AmbiguousMatchException`.  
To fix this, you must use the overload of `GetMethod` that specifies parameter types explicitly.

```

- A: True
- B: False
- C: Compilation error
- D: Runtime exception

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
The output is **`True`**.  
Anonymous types in C# override `Equals` and `GetHashCode` to provide value-based equality, meaning two instances with the same property names and values are considered equal.  
Here, both `a` and `b` have identical properties (`X = 1`, `Y = 2`), so `a.Equals(b)` returns `True`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In C#, when using an indexer like `d['A']`, the character `'A'` is implicitly converted to its underlying `int` value (Unicode code point 65).  
Since there's an indexer that accepts an `int`, that one is selected, and `"int"` is printed.

###### 59. What's the output?

```csharp

using System.Linq.Expressions;

Expression<Func<int, int>> inner = z => z + 10;
Expression<Func<int, Func<int, int>>> outer =
    y => x => inner.Compile()(x * y);

var compiled = outer.Compile();
Console.WriteLine(compiled(3)(2));

```

- A: 16
- B: 23
- C: 26
- D: Compilation error

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The outer expression takes `y` and returns a function that takes `x`.  
Inside that function, it compiles `inner` (`z => z + 10`) and applies it to `x * y`.  
When calling `compiled(3)(2)`, `x = 2`, `y = 3`, so `x * y = 6`.  
The inner function then computes `6 + 10 = 16`.  
Thus, the final output is `16`.

- A: Alpha then Beta
- B: Compile-time error
- C: Runtime exception due to ambiguity
- D: Alpha twice

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In C# 8.0+, default interface methods are dispatched based on the interface reference type **at runtime**.
`a.Speak()` calls the default `IAlpha.Speak()` â†’ prints "Alpha".
`b.Speak()` calls the default `IBeta.Speak()` â†’ prints "Beta".
Although `Delta` implements both interfaces with default methods, there is no conflict **until** you try to call `Speak()` on `Delta` directly, which is not done here.

- B: Compile-time error: Ping is not implemented in Impl
- C: Runtime error: method not found
- D: Nothing is printed

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Even though `IOne` provides a default implementation of `Ping()`, the method is **not available via the implementing class directly**.
Calling `obj.Ping()` requires `Impl` to provide an explicit implementation or for you to cast the object to the interface type.
To make it work, you could change the call to `((IOne)obj).Ping();`.

    Console.WriteLine(string.Join(",", span.ToArray()));
}


```

- A: 1 42 3
- B: Compile-time error
- C: Runtime error
- D: 1 2 3

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

This code uses `stackalloc` to allocate a `Span<int>` on the stack with values {1, 2, 3}. 
The `fixed` statement pins the memory location of the span's underlying array, so a pointer can be used safely.

Then, the pointer is used to overwrite the second element (`*(ptr + 1) = 42`). 
As a result, the original span now contains [1, 42, 3], and that is printed.

- B: 1000

#### Answer: C

The `Interlocked.Increment` method performs an atomic operation, ensuring thread-safe incrementing of `counter`.
Each thread runs 1000 increments, for a total of 2000.
Atomicity is guaranteed, so no race conditions occur, and the result is exactly 2000.

```

- A: Compilation error due to invalid assignment
- B: Runtime InvalidCastException
- C: "Woof"
- D: "Animal"

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `IProducer<out T>` interface is covariant (`out`), allowing `IProducer<Dog>` to be assigned to `IProducer<Animal>`.
This works because a `Dog` is an `Animal`, and `out` ensures only reading (not writing) of type T.
The method `Speak()` is overridden in `Dog`, so `"Woof"` is printed.

Covariance allows you to use a more derived type than originally specified.  
In C#, it's supported in generic interfaces and delegates using the `out` keyword, and it means you can assign something like `IEnumerable<Dog>` to `IEnumerable<Animal>`.  
It works only for output positions (return values), ensuring type safety by allowing only reading, not writing.

Contravariance allows you to use a more generic (less derived) type than originally specified.
It's supported in generic interfaces and delegates using the `in` keyword, meaning you can assign `Action<Animal>` to `Action<Dog>`.
Contravariance works only in input positions (method parameters), allowing safe writing but no reading.

This code defines a `struct` with implicit conversions between `Meter` and `double`.

By default, `Math.Round(double)` uses "banker's rounding" (also called "round half to even").

- C: 68, A2,  65
- D: 3A, 1A2, A3

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In C#, the `'A'` character has an ASCII value of `65`.  
Integer and `char` values are converted to `int` during arithmetic operations.

- `1 + 2 + 'A'` â†’ `3 + 65 = 68`
- `1 + 'A' + 2` â†’ `1 + 65 + 2 = 68`
- `'A' + 1 + 2` â†’ `65 + 1 + 2 = 68`

No string concatenation occurs, as all operands are numeric, so the result is pure integer addition.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In C# 8.0 and later, interfaces can contain **default implementations** and even **explicit reimplementations** of members from other interfaces.

In this case:
- `IBase` defines a default implementation of `Hello()`.
- `IDerived` explicitly reimplements `IBase.Hello()` with a new body.

Even though the call is made through an `IBase` reference, the runtime resolves it to `IDerived`'s explicit implementation because `IDerived` overrides `IBase.Hello()` explicitly.

Hence, it prints: `Hello from IDerived`.

- A: Process from Alpha

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Although `value` is an int, the base class method `Process(int)` is hidden (not overridden) by `Beta.Process(double)`.
Since `Beta` defines a new method with the same name, overload resolution happens within `Beta`, and `int` is implicitly converted to `double`.
Therefore, `Beta.Process(double)` is called, and the output is "Process from Beta".
